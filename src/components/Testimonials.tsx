When I stepped foot on that bus, I knew that this is going to be amazing to get to know you. I absolutely loved to go on hikes and talk while hiking, I loved to play football with Greeks and the Portuguese also including Germans ðŸ˜Š. I loved to see and host the cultural nights, I wasn't able to talk to ALL of you, but with the ones I talked it was amazing."</p>
